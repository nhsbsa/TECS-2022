        <p>If you were not entitled to free NHS prescriptions you will be sent a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN).</p>
        <p>We send the enquiry letter before the PCN to give you time to confirm you were entitled to free NHS
            prescriptions
            which can stop a PCN being issued.</p>
        <p>If you do not confirm you were entitled to free NHS prescriptions within [number] days (by [date]) we will
            send a PCN.</p>
        <p>You will not be able to make a payment until you receive the PCN.</p>
        <p>Once you have received it, youâ€™ll be able to use this service to pay your penalty charge.</p>
