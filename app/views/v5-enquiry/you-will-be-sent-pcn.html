      Not entitled to free NHS prescriptions
    </h2>
    <p>If you were not entitled to free NHS prescriptions you will be sent a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN).</p>
    <p>We send the enquiry letter before the PCN to give you time to confirm you were entitled to free NHS prescriptions
      which can stop a PCN being issued.</p>
    <p>The PCN will be issued within [number] of days (by [date]).</p>
    <p>You will not be able to make a payment until you receive the PCN.</p>
    <p>Once you have received it, youâ€™ll be able to use this service to pay your penalty charge.</p>
