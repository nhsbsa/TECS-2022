    <p>If you were not entitled to free NHS prescriptions you will be sent a Penalty Charge Notice.</p>
    <p>We send the enquiry letter before the Penalty Charge Notice to give you time to confirm you were entitled to free NHS prescriptions which can stop a penalty charge being issued.</p>
    <p>If you do not confirm you were entitled to free NHS prescriptions within 28 days (by {{ 28 | alterTodaysDateByNumberOfDays }}) we will send a Penalty Charge Notice. You will not be able to make a payment until you receive this.</p>
    <p>Once you have received it, youâ€™ll be able to use this service to pay your penalty charge.</p>
