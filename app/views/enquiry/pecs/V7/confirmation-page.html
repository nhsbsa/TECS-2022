    <h2>How to avoid a future enquiry letter</h2>
    <p>We match exemptions using a combination of your:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>name</li>
      <li>address</li>
      <li>date of birth</li>
      <li>NHS number</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make sure these are correct at your GP surgery, dental practice, and any benefits organisations.</p>
    <p>If any of your details are not up to date, you may receive another enquiry letter in the future.</p>
