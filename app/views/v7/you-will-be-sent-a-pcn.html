    <p>If you were not entitled to free NHS prescriptions you will be sent a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN).
    </p>
    <p>
      We send the enquiry letter before the PCN to give you time to confirm you were entitled to free NHS prescriptions
      which can stop a PCN being issued.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not confirm you were entitled to free NHS prescriptions within [number] days (by [date]) we will send a
      PCN.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will not be able to make a payment until you receive the PCN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have received it, youâ€™ll be able to use this service to pay your penalty charge.</p>
